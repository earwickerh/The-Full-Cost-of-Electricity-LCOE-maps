# The-Full-Cost-of-Electricity-LCOE-maps
# Created by Joshua Daniel Rhodes, 2016

This repo holds the code needed to recreate the LCOE maps used in the Full Cost of Electricity Project.

The first version of these maps are the same as found in this academic journal artice: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516306875

There is an online version of these maps that coudn be found here: http://calculators.energy.utexas.edu/lcoe_map/#/county/tech
	** note the change log on the map to indicate changes from the origional values found in the paper above.

This code will only generate the final map (Figure 4 in the above mentioned academic journal article). Auxiliary maps can be generated in a similiar manor.
